# Medusa 2.0 - Inter-University CTF Competition

A high-performance React application for the Medusa 2.0 cybersecurity competition platform.

## üöÄ Performance Optimizations

This project has been optimized for production with the following improvements:

### Bundle Optimization
- **Code Splitting**: Automatic route-based code splitting reduces initial bundle size
- **Vendor Chunking**: React, UI components, and utilities are split into separate chunks
- **Lazy Loading**: Pages are loaded on-demand for faster initial page loads
- **Tree Shaking**: Unused code is automatically removed during build

### Current Bundle Sizes (Gzipped)
- **React Vendor**: 44.92 kB
- **Main App**: 21.01 kB
- **UI Components**: 18.61 kB
- **Home Page**: 9.36 kB (lazy loaded)
- **Registration Page**: 3.68 kB (lazy loaded)
- **Total Initial Load**: ~85 kB (vs 112 kB before optimization)

### Runtime Optimizations
- **React.memo**: Prevents unnecessary re-renders of components
- **useCallback**: Optimizes event handlers and functions
- **Service Worker**: Enables offline functionality and caching
- **Image Optimization**: Proper loading attributes and lazy loading

### SEO & Performance
- **Meta Tags**: Comprehensive Open Graph and Twitter Card support
- **Structured Data**: JSON-LD schema markup for search engines
- **Font Optimization**: Optimized Google Fonts loading strategy
- **Resource Hints**: DNS prefetch and preconnect for external resources

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

- **Frontend Framework**: React 18 with TypeScript
- **Build Tool**: Vite with SWC compiler
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with custom cyber theme
- **UI Components**: shadcn/ui with Radix UI primitives
- **Routing**: React Router v6 with lazy loading
- **State Management**: React Query for server state
- **Icons**: Lucide React
- **Package Manager**: Bun

## üì¶ Installation & Setup

```sh
# Clone the repository
git clone <YOUR_GIT_URL>

# Navigate to the project directory
cd medusa-2.0

# Install dependencies
bun install

# Start development server
bun run dev

# Build for production
bun run build

# Preview production build
bun run preview

# Analyze bundle size
bun run build:analyze
```

## üéØ Development Scripts

- `bun run dev` - Start development server
- `bun run build` - Production build with optimizations
- `bun run build:analyze` - Build and analyze bundle composition
- `bun run lint` - Run ESLint
- `bun run lint:fix` - Fix ESLint errors automatically
- `bun run type-check` - TypeScript type checking
- `bun run preview` - Preview production build locally

## üîß Configuration

### Vite Configuration
- **Chunk Splitting**: Automatic vendor and route-based splitting
- **Minification**: Terser with console/debugger removal
- **CSS Code Splitting**: Separate CSS chunks for better caching
- **Source Maps**: Disabled in production for smaller bundles

### Performance Features
- **Service Worker**: Automatic registration for offline support
- **Lazy Loading**: Route-based code splitting
- **Image Optimization**: Loading and decoding optimizations
- **Font Loading**: Optimized Google Fonts strategy

## üìä Performance Metrics

### Before Optimization
- Initial Bundle: 364.40 kB (111.97 kB gzipped)
- Single large chunk with all dependencies

### After Optimization
- Initial Load: ~85 kB gzipped
- 11 optimized chunks with intelligent splitting
- Lazy-loaded routes for better performance
- 23% reduction in initial bundle size

## üê≥ Docker Deployment

This project includes Docker support for easy deployment and development.

### Docker Files Included
- `Dockerfile` - Production build with nginx
- `Dockerfile.dev` - Development build with hot reload
- `docker-compose.yml` - Orchestration for easy deployment
- `nginx.conf` - Optimized nginx configuration for React SPA
- `.dockerignore` - Optimized Docker build context

### Quick Start with Docker

#### Production Deployment
```sh
# Build and run with Docker Compose (recommended)
docker-compose up -d

# Or build and run manually
docker build -t medusa-2.0 .
docker run -d -p 3000:80 --name medusa-frontend medusa-2.0
```

#### Development with Docker
```sh
# Start development environment with hot reload
docker-compose --profile dev up -d

# Access the application
# Production: http://localhost:3000
# Development: http://localhost:8080
```

### Deployment Script
The enhanced `deploy.sh` script supports multiple deployment methods:

```sh
# Traditional deployment (build and upload manually)
./deploy.sh production traditional

# Docker deployment
./deploy.sh production docker

# Docker Compose deployment
./deploy.sh production docker-compose

# Development with Docker Compose
./deploy.sh development docker-compose
```

### Docker Features
- **Multi-stage builds** for optimized image size
- **nginx server** for production with proper SPA routing
- **Gzip compression** and caching headers
- **Security headers** (CSP, XSS protection, etc.)
- **Health check endpoint** at `/health`
- **Hot reload** in development mode
- **Optimized build context** with `.dockerignore`
